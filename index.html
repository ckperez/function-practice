        <h1>Biography</h1>
        <p>I was born a poor Mexican child in Orange, California. Also Irish. But not Catholic. I was raised in a Lutheran church-and-school system. It was weird. I played football in middle school, wrestled in high school, and got an academic scholarship to the University of Arizona. I studied linguistics and ended up staying in Tucson, Arizona for 10 years. I got a job in marketing, married the HR lady, and moved to Seattle for Code Fellows.</P>
