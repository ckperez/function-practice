## Problem 1
- Made sum() function that takes in 2 numbers and console logs the equation in plain English
## Problem 2
- Made multiply function that takes in 2 numbers, multiplies them, and console logs the equation in plain English
## Problem 3
- Made sumAndMultiply function that takes in 3 numbers. I used the sum function and multiply function twice each within this function, to get the final sum and product. Also, had to add return statements to the first two functions.
## Problem 4
- Wrote a function that takes an array of numbers and sums them. To do this, I initialized a variable `total` at 0, and looped through the array to add each element to `total`.
## Problem 5
- Wrote a function that takes an array of numbers and multiplies them. To do this, I initialized a variable `total` at 1, and looped through the array to multiply each element by `total`.
